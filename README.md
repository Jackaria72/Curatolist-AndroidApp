# Curatolist-AndroidApp

Hello and welcome to the Curatolist Android Application Github page!

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository, and any of the files contained within, is part of a larger project.

> This Android application relies upon data and services provided to it by the Curatolist API.
> 
> The RendezVenue API exists in a separate repository which you can find [here](https://github.com/Jackaria72/CuratolistAPI).

## Set Up
If you already have our companion API up and running you can begin setting up the Android Application. To do so you will need:
- Android Studio
- Java 21

To use the application, please fork and clone the repository. Open it in Android studio and then run the application, you will need to have the API running whilst you do, or have limited functionality.

Using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, Curatorlist is a responsive and fluid application allowing users to seamlessly brows through collections of artworks and add them to their own personal galleries.

Utilising Coil to display the fantastic images provided with the data and Room to allow users to save the Artworks to their own personal Exhibits, right on their own device! Allowing them to carry their favourite artworks with them wherever they go!
